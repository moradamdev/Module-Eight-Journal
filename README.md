-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs to implement them into a program starts with interviewing users. Talking to the users directly is the easiest way to learn what the users want in the program and learn what the users don't want in the program. We can create user stories with the information we gathered from talking to them and use the user stories to create a good product. Developers in the development team will read the user stories which will have information such as what the user wants added, and criteria on whether or not that thing that was added is good enough. Just from these alone, the developers know exactly what features to add, and what the features need to do in order to be acceptable.

-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Having a good plan before starting the development is crucial. If you don't know what you're programming, then there is no way to make something good. Constant iteration is also crucial during the development phase and if you don't revise your code or are unable to take criticism, then the software you're developing won't be any good. This is why I hope to incorporate scrum meetings into future development work when working in a team because it is a very efficient way to gather ideas and get the teams situated every day before they start work.

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think a good team member is someone who is able to learn from others and teach others equally. Assuming the team is competent, then everyone there will be able to program, but a really good team member can guide others who struggle, and accept the wisdom from other developers. In general a good team member is someone who lifts others up around them.
